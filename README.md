=====================================================================================================

”Gutland Liberatus” is an open world RPG that is taking place in an alternate reality, on the 
island of Gotland around the beginning of the nineteenth century. The game provides a story
about a conflict between three factions; the Gutish, the Swedes and the Danes. The player can
choose to help any faction, but they don’t have to. One of the win conditions could be, for example,
to take a boat off the island and go live in another country.

The player can choose to start in one of three larger cities. These are: Wisby, Kappelhamn and
Näs. The player is allowed to traverse freely, but these cities can help them decide which faction they
want to help. The story progresses through a reputation system. Almost every mission in the game
will provide a small bonus of reputation to one faction. When a certain threshold has been met, this
faction will seek to contact the player. The player can then join said faction, ignore them completely,
or decide to be a turncoat to join another faction instead.

The player can take the role as a bruiser or a diplomat (or a mix between). The combat system is
akin to jRPGs, where the player has a number of abilities they can perform. The abilities depend on
three things: abilities they’ve unlocked through quests, weapon in hand and environment. The player
does not gain levels, as in traditional RPGs, but instead grows more powerful horizontally. A player
may pay for a fencing lesson and this might reward them with a new ability that can only be used if
they hold a sword, for example. Environmental attacks depend on where the fight is taking place. If
the player is in a bar, they could pick up a bottle as a blunt weapon. The bottle can then be
destroyed, and the player will have a sharp weapon instead. Or they can use the bottle as a ranged
weapon.

Enemies may be fought at long range or close range. Where the enemy is in relation to the player
is animated by having enemies at a close proximity larger and more up front on the screen, while
enemies at a distance are smaller and thus farther away. The player does not always have to fight,
though. Similar (but not as silly) to Undertale’s “Act”-system, the player can opt to talk their way out
of a tough situation. When encountered by bandits they can attempt to bribe their way out of
trouble.

Money is an important resource. It can be used for bribes, but also for safe passage between
towns. Rather than walk the distance between Wisby and Kappelhamn and risk encountering
bandits, the player can simply buy a train ticket. Money is also used to pay rent. Becoming homeless
due to spending money improperly is a very real threat, and having a home increases the player’s
recovery rate. Wounds heal over time, but is promoted by eating and sleeping properly.
The point of the game is to allow the player to do, more or less, whatever they want to do. The
story acts as a cursor towards the end, but it is up to the player how he or she will reach it. When a
new player begin playing the game they will soon learn that the island is on the brink of a rebellious
uproar, even if they never asked a question about it. However, they don’t really have to do anything
about it, if they don’t want to.
